# Welcome {docsify-ignore-all}

You have found the Combinatorial Auction Visualizer (CAVis) - an online, interactive platform for **combinatorial auctions**. The goal is that students/instructors/researchers can use this platform to learn about different auction formats and their advantages and disadvantages in an interactive way.

In this documentation, you will find plenty of relevant information about how to use the software and some background information about certain interesting problems that arose in combinatorial auctions from the past.

## About

CAVis was developed at the [University of Zurich](https://www.uzh.ch/) in collaboration with [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu/).

CAVis is an open-source web application, published under the GNU Affero license (Contributions are welcome!).
The source code of all components is [published](https://github.com/marketdesignresearch/) on GitHub.

Notable dependencies (each also developed and open-sourced by us) that enable this visualization are:

- [Mechanism Library](https://github.com/marketdesignresearch/mechlib/): A java library that provides the core concepts for several kinds of market mechanisms
- [SATS](http://spectrumauctions.org/): A "Spectrum Auction Test Suite" that provides the models and Winner Determination Problems of several spectrum auction domains
