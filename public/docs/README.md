# Welcome {docsify-ignore-all}

You have found the Combinatorial Auction Visualizer (CAVis) - an online, interactive platform for **combinatorial auctions**. The goal is that students/instructors/researchers can use this platform to learn about different auction formats and their advantages and disadvantages in an interactive way.

In this documentation, you will find plenty of relevant information about how to use the software and some background information about certain interesting problems that arose in combinatorial auctions from the past.
